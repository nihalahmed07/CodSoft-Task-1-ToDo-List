## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed on your machine
- A device or emulator to run the app

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nihalahmed07/CodSoft-Task-1-ToDo-List.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Let Android Studio install any required dependencies.
4. Build and run the app on your device or emulator.

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. In your Firebase project, add an Android app and follow the setup steps. You'll need the package name of your Android app.
3. Download the `google-services.json` file provided by Firebase and place it in your project's `app` directory.
4. Add the Firebase SDK to your project. Update your `build.gradle` files as follows:

**Project-level `build.gradle` (`build.gradle`)**:
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'  // Check for the latest version
        }
    }
    ```

**App-level `build.gradle` (`app/build.gradle`)**:
    ```gradle
    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

    dependencies {
        // Firebase SDK
        implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:31.1.1') // Check for the latest version
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage'
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database'
        // Other dependencies
    }
    ```

5. Initialize Firebase in your application. Update your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:
    ```java
    import com.google.firebase.FirebaseApp;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this);
        // Other initialization code
    }
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the app to view your list of tasks.
2. Tap the "Add Task" button to create a new task.
3. Fill in the task title and optional description, set priority and due date, then save.
4. Tap on a task to edit its details.
5. Swipe left or right on a task to mark it as completed or delete it.
6. All tasks are saved locally on your device and synced with Firebase Storage for persistence across devices.
